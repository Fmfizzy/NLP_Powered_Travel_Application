# NLP_Powered_Travel_Application
Final year project , NLP based travel recommendation algorithm
The following application allows users to enter their target destination, date, number of participants, and special requests in natural language form. For example, "I wish to go to Colombo tmrw with my 3 friends and would like to avoid outdoor activities." Users will then receive appropriate recommendations based on their location and request. Additionally, they will be provided with pertinent information such as the weather forecast for the requested region on the specified day ("tmrw," or defaulting to the current day if not provided), as well as a graph depicting the fluctuation of infectious diseases in that area over the previous year. Appropriate precautions will also be recommended based on this data.
